1. To create an 4096 bit SSH key, you need to type in terminal "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"". Once that key has been created you will be prompted with a question asking where you want the file to be saved to, and then it will also ask you to set a password so that you can use the key. 

2. After copying the public key, you can send it to other parties, to authenticate yourself, it can also be used if you want to send encrypted messages to someone.

3. The private key should be protected with a password that only you know.
